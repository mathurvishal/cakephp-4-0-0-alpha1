<?php // Dummy php code whatever ?>
{% for number in [1,2,3] %}
    {{ number }}
{% endfor %}

{% for number in [1,2,3] %}
    number
{% endfor %}

This is all going to be squashed on one line:
{% for number in [1,2,3] -%}
{{ " " }}{{ number }}
{%- endfor -%}
. This bit of text too

This will not be on one line though
{% for number in [1,2,3] %}
    number
{% endfor -%}
And neither this text because "number" ends with a newline
